            I am a retail cannabis manager aspiring for a new career path in web
            development or software engineering. In my free time, I work on
            teaching myself to code, produce/mix/master music, graphic design,
            and video edit. I aim to be a jack of all trades, unveiling the
            mystery from concepts I find interesting, and teaching myself with
            the graces of the internet.
